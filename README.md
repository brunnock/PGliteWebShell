# PGLite Demo

Interact with a PGLite database in your browser.

Enter SQL commands and see data on the fly.

Requires `node` and `npm`.

After downloading this and entering the directory, enter `npm install`. After it is successfully installed, you can run `npm run dev` to run it locally.

There's a live demo at https://sean.brunnock.com/PERN/PGLite/ .
